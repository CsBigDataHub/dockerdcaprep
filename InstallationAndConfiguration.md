#Docker Essential Training: 1 Installation and Configuration
##Sizing Docker
* Before you install Docker, it's important to understand the prerequisites and insure that your hardware is sized appropriately. For the community edition there are no specific hardware requirements other than those of whatever operating system you're installing Docker on. For Docker Enterprise edition, because Universal Control Plane and Docker Trusted Registry, which are important pieces of the enterprise edition, require much more resources than Docker's engine itself, you should be aware of the specific guidelines for deploying UCP and DTR.
